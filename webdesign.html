                In todayâ€™s digital age, an online presence is a crucial tool for personal branding, networking, and professional growth. For my final project, I aim to design and develop a personal portfolio website that will serve as an introduction to my work, interests, and skills. The website will act as an online portfolio where I can showcase my abilities, document my journey, and make it easier for others to contact me. Additionally, this project provides me with the opportunity to bring to life a personal aspiration of mine: to create and manage my very own website.
