                This report provides a financial comparison between low-cost and full-service airlines, examining their revenue and expenditure patterns. Drawing data from civil aviation websites, Baidu, Ctrip, and annual reports from airlines, the study offers insights into the operational dynamics of these two distinct business models within the aviation industry.
                The aviation industry is marked by a diversity of business models, with low-cost carriers and full-service airlines being the most prominent. This report, "Little Talent in the Air" by Guo Zhengyue, delves into the financial aspects of these two sectors, comparing their operational costs, revenue streams, and profitability. The study focuses on civilian aircraft, specifically comparing ordinary Boeing and Airbus planes used by low-cost and premium airlines under the assumption of no accidents or errors within the specified timeframe.
