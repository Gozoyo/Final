                Summary: A healthy life is inseparable from daily exercise. Nowadays,
                people are also paying more and more attention to the effectiveness of
                sports and the health protection of sports, hoping that they can do
                standard and effective, and also hope that they can reduce the injuries
                caused by sports. Therefore, in view of these two popular directions,
                a sports assistance system is designed to identify the movement state
                of the human body through artificial intelligence technology, extract
                the bone state, and provide real-time feedback and prompts to the
                movements of athletes. At the start of the research, the system used
                blazepose as the core, but errors were encountered during the research. 
                However, errors were encountered during the research, so the system was 
                eventually changed to use openpose as the core of the system. And further
                optimised the system based on openpose and coco18 and body_25.At present, 
                the system can realize the functions
                of prompting the action error and judging the standard degree of
                posture according to the feedback of the exercise state. The system
                can assist people to exercise, improve the efficiency and safety of
                sports, and explore the wisdom and standardization of smart fitness,
                as well as the intelligence and standardization of body testing.
