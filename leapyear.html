                This report delves into the intricacies of leap year calculations, exploring the historical and astronomical reasons behind their implementation in our calendar system. It examines the stories behind the "disappearance" of ten days and the peculiar naming of the October Revolution, leading to an in-depth analysis of the rules governing leap years and the ongoing efforts to minimize calendrical inaccuracies.
                The concept of a leap year is deeply rooted in our calendar system, designed to account for the discrepancies between the Earth's orbit around the Sun and our standard 365-day year. This report, titled "Unraveling the Truth About Leap Years," authored by Guo Zhengyue from Class 6(1) in May 2018, presents a comprehensive examination of why leap years are necessary and how their rules have evolved over time.
